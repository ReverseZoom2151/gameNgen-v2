## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gameNgen-v2.git
cd gameNgen-v2
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install PyTorch with CUDA
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130

# Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run tests
python tests/test_all_tiers.py

# Should see:
# [READY] Tier 1: Chrome Dino
# [READY] Tier 2: DOOM Lite
# [READY] Tier 3: Full DOOM
```

### 4. Create Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints** where possible
- Maximum line length: **100 characters**
- Use **meaningful variable names**

**Example:**

```python
def train_model(
    config: dict,
    data_dir: str,
    num_steps: int = 1000
) -> dict:
    """
    Train diffusion model.

    Args:
        config: Configuration dictionary
        data_dir: Path to training data
        num_steps: Number of training steps

    Returns:
        Training metrics dictionary
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Documentation

- **All functions** should have docstrings
- Use **Google-style docstrings**
- Include **type hints**
- Explain **why**, not just **what**

### Code Organization

- Keep functions **focused and small**
- Use **descriptive names**
- **Avoid** deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- **Extract** complex logic into helper functions

### Testing

- **Write tests** for new features
- Ensure existing tests **still pass**
- Aim for **meaningful coverage**, not just high percentage

```bash
# Run tests before committing
python tests/test_all_tiers.py
```

---

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Follow **Conventional Commits** format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(diffusion): Add text conditioning support

Implements CLIP-based text conditioning for game generation.
Allows users to specify game content via text prompts.

Closes #42
```

```
fix(agent): Correct reward calculation in DQN

Fixed off-by-one error in reward accumulation that caused
training instability.
```

```
docs(readme): Update installation instructions

Added troubleshooting section for common CUDA issues.
```

### Commit Best Practices

- **One logical change** per commit
- Write **clear, descriptive** messages
- Reference **issue numbers** where applicable
- Keep commits **focused and atomic**

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Before Submitting

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main

```bash
# Update your branch
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# Run tests
python tests/test_all_tiers.py

# Check formatting (if using pre-commit)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 2. Create Pull Request

**Title:** Clear, descriptive summary

**Description should include:**
- **What** does this PR do?
- **Why** is this change needed?
- **How** does it work?
- **Testing** performed
- **Related issues** (if any)

**PR Template:**

```markdown

Describe testing performed

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-reviewed code
- [ ] Commented complex code

```

### 3. Review Process

- Maintainers will review your PR
- Address any feedback
- Make requested changes
- Once approved, we'll merge!

**Be patient:**
- Reviews may take a few days
- Feedback is meant to improve code quality
- Multiple review rounds are normal

---

## Development Workflow

### Typical Contribution Flow

```bash
# 1. Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 3. Make changes
# ... edit code ...

# 4. Test changes
python tests/test_all_tiers.py

# 5. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add my feature"

# 6. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 7. Create PR on GitHub
```

### Working with Multiple Commits

If your PR has multiple commits, we may ask you to:
- **Squash commits** into logical units
- **Rebase** instead of merge
- **Clean up** commit history

```bash
# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Last 3 commits
```

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/test_all_tiers.py

# Run specific tests
python tests/test_diffusion_simple.py

# Run with coverage (if installed)
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### Writing Tests

**Location:** Place tests in `tests/` directory

**Naming:** `test_<module>_<function>.py`

**Structure:**
```python
def test_my_feature():
    """Test description"""
    # Setup
    model = create_model()

    # Execute
    result = model.do_something()

    # Verify
    assert result == expected_value
    print("âœ“ Test passed")
```
