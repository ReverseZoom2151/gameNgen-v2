- `resume_training.py` - Easy resume from checkpoints
- `visualize_data.py` - Visualize recorded gameplay data
- `compare_models.py` - Compare different checkpoint quality
- `export_video.py` - Batch export gameplay videos
- `monitor_training.py` - Real-time training monitoring

**Advanced Features** (Beyond Paper):

- Text-conditioned game generation with CLIP (`src/diffusion/text_conditioning.py`)
- Image-based modding system for editing games (`src/diffusion/image_modding.py`)
- Hierarchical memory system for longer context (`src/diffusion/hierarchical_memory.py`)

**GitHub Infrastructure:**

- CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guidelines
- GitHub Actions CI - Automated testing
- Issue templates (bug report, feature request)
- CHANGELOG.md - This file

### Changed
